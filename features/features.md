# 🌺 Twilight Garden — Complete Feature Matrix

_Twilight Garden is a beautifully designed menstrual cycle tracking and couples wellness ecosystem. It runs as a Progressive Web App, native Android app (Capacitor), and Windows desktop app (Tauri). This document defines every feature across four core verticals: The Primary User, The Supporter, The Intelligence, and The Relationship._

> **Important:** A Supabase connection is required to use the app. All user accounts, cycle data, couple pairing, encrypted messaging, notifications, and AI features depend on real-time cloud infrastructure. The app is not offline-first — it requires an active internet connection for core functionality.

## 👩🏻‍🦰 The Menstruator (Primary User) Experience

### 🖼️ Core Aesthetic & Interface

- **Seasons Theme Engine**: Dynamic, handcrafted themes built into `index.css` (e.g., _Blush_, _Twilight_, dark/light modes) that recolor the entire interface, including gradients, surfaces, text layers, and navigation.
- **Framer Motion Physics**: The entire application uses spring-based fluid animations. Card morphs, modal entrances, navigation transitions, and page slides all employ `framer-motion` layout animations with soft, bouncy physics.
- **Visual Ergonomics Control**: Global toggle states (`animationsEnabled`, `solidNavBg`) allow users with motion sensitivity to switch to a static, high-visibility mode instantly.
- **Feature Carousel**: An interactive onboarding carousel (`FeatureCarousel.tsx`) showcasing all major features during first launch.
- **Tutorial System**: Built-in contextual tutorials (`TutorialContext.tsx`, `tutorialData.ts`) that guide users through features on first interaction.

### 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: All Love Notes (text messages, images, voice messages) between partners are encrypted using **ECDH P-256 key exchange** with AES-GCM. Private keys never leave the device in plaintext. Supabase only stores encrypted blobs.
- **PIN Lock**: Users set a hardware-local PIN via `PinSetupPrompt.tsx`. The app forces a numpad lock screen before rendering any private data on launch.
- **Cloud Key Backup**: Encrypted backup of the private key (encrypted with PIN via PBKDF2) can be stored in the cloud for multi-device recovery.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Users can register multiple devices (phone, tablet, desktop) with independent encryption keys. `Settings.tsx` provides device management with the ability to view, name, and unlink devices.
- **Identity Lockdown**: `IdentityLockdownPrompt.tsx` detects suspicious session states and locks the app until the user re-verifies their identity.
- **Security Verification**: `SecurityVerification.tsx` provides a comprehensive security check flow before accessing sensitive features like the Love Notes chat.
- **Granular Partner Privacy**: The primary user controls exactly what data is shared with their partner. They can share cycle phase only, or include moods, symptoms, and logs individually.
- **Ghost Mode**: A single toggle (`toggleGhostMode()`) that instantly hides all shared data from the partner without breaking the pairing.

### 📝 Health Tracking & Logging
